# twilio_serverless_build

Manages a Serverless build.
If polling is enabled then the create step will poll until the build status is either `completed` or `failed` or the max attempts threshold is reached.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "twilio_serverless_service" "service" {
  unique_name   = "twilio-test"
  friendly_name = "twilio-test"
}

resource "twilio_serverless_function" "function" {
  service_sid   = twilio_serverless_service.service.sid
  friendly_name = "test"
}

resource "twilio_serverless_function_version" "function_version" {
  service_sid       = twilio_serverless_service.service.sid
  function_sid      = twilio_serverless_function.function.sid
  content           = <<EOF
exports.handler = function (context, event, callback) {
  callback(null, "Hello World");
};
EOF
  content_type      = "application/javascript"
  content_file_name = "helloWorld.js"
  path              = "/test-function"
  visibility        = "public"
}

resource "twilio_serverless_build" "build" {
  service_sid           = twilio_serverless_service.service.sid
  function_version_sids = [twilio_serverless_function_version.function_version.sid]
  dependencies = {
    "twilio" : "3.6.3"
  }

  polling {
    enabled = true
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

- `service_sid` - (Mandatory) The Service SID associated with the build. Changing this forces a new resource to be created
- `asset_version_sids` - (Optional) List of Asset Version Sids to be included in the build. Changing this forces a new resource to be created
- `function_version_sids` - (Optional) List of Function Version Sids to be included in the build. Changing this forces a new resource to be created
- `dependencies` - (Optional) Map of dependencies to be included in the build. Changing this forces a new resource to be created
- `polling` - (Optional) A `polling` block as documented below.

---

A `polling` block supports the following:

- `enabled` - (Required) Enable or or disable polling of the build.
- `max_attempts` - (Optional) The maximum number of polling attempts. Default is 30
- `delay_in_ms` - (Optional) The time in milliseconds to wait between polling attempts.
